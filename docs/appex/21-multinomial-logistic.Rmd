The main objective of this analysis is to understand how encouragement affects the frequency that children watch *Sesame Street*. We will use the following variables: 

**Response:**

- <font class="vocab">`viewcat`</font>
    + 1: rarely watched show
    + 2: once or twice a week
      + 3: three to five times a week
      + 4: watched show on average more than five times a week

**Predictors:**

- <font class="vocab">`age`:</font> child's age in months
- <font class="vocab">`prenumb`: </font>score on numbers pretest (0 to 54)
- <font class="vocab">`prelet`: </font>score on letters pretest (0 to 58)
- <font class="vocab">`viewenc`:</font> 1: encouraged to watch, 2: not encouraged
- <font class="vocab">`site:`</font>
  + 1: three to five year old from urban area
  + 2: four year old from suburban area
  + 3: from rural area with high socioeconomic status
  + 4: from rural area with low socioeconomic status
  + 5: from Spanish speaking home

```{r}
# read in dataset
sesame <- read_csv("data/sesame.csv")
```

```{r}
# mean-center relevant continuous variables, make categorical variables factors
sesame <- sesame %>% 
  mutate(viewcat = as.factor(viewcat), 
         site = as.factor(site), 
         prenumbCent = prenumb - mean(prenumb), 
         preletCent = prelet - mean(prelet), 
         ageCent = age - mean(age),
         viewenc = ifelse(viewenc == 1, "Encouraged", "Not Encouraged"))

### Questions

1. We'd like to fit a model to predict how often a child in this study watched *Sesame Street*. What type of model should we fit? Briefly explain your choice. 

2. Describe how you would conduct exploratory data analysis. What plots and/or summary statistics would you include? What information would you learn from the exploratory data analysis?

3. Make a plot to examine the relationship between the response and `viewenc`, the primary variable of interest in this analysis. What do you learn from the plot?

4. Make a plot to examine the relationship between the response and a quantitative predictor variable. What do you learn from the plot?


5. The primary objective of the experiment was to understand the effect of encouragement, `viewenc`, on viewership. Explain the process you would use to select the final model. 

6. Conduct model selection and display the final model.

7. Interpret the intercept associated with the odds of a child being in the category `viewcat == 2` versus `viewcat == 1`. 

8. Interpret the coefficient one numeric predictor in terms of the odds of a child being in the category `viewcat == 2` versus `viewcat == 1`. Based on the confidence interval for the coefficient, is the numeric predictor a statistically significant predictor of viewership?

9. The primary objective of the experiment was to understand the effect of encouragement `viewenc` on viewership. Does encouragement have a significant effect on viewership? If so, describe the effect. Otherwise, explain why not.

10. We want to test if there is a statistically significant interaction between `viewenc` and `site`. Use the appropriate test to determine if this interaction is significant and should be included in the model. 

11. How would you assess the appropriateness of the model fit? Describe the plots, tables, and/or calculations you would create to assess model fit. 

12. How would you assess the model's power in predicting the a child's viewership? Use the appropriate plot, table, and/or calculation to make a conclusion.
