## Merge Conflicts
 
---

### What are merge conflicts?

When two collaborators make changes to a file and push the file to their repo, 
git merges these two files.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width=300, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/03/merge-no-conflict.png")
```

If these two files have conflicting content on the same line, git will produce a <font class="vocab">merge conflict</font>.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width=300, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/03/merge-conflict.png")
```

---

## Resolving merge conflicts

- Merge conflicts need to be resolved manually, as they require a human intervention

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width=800, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/03/merge-conflict-identifiers.png")
```

- To resolve the merge conflict
  - decide if you want to keep only your text or the text on GitHub or 
  incorporate changes from both texts
  - delete the conflict markers `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>` and make the 
  changes you want in the final merge

---

### Practce dealing with merge conflicts

- **Everyone**: Clone the repo starting with **merge-** in RStudio Cloud (`merge-conflicts-TEAMNAME`), 
and open the R Markdown file. Remember to configure git! 

- Assign the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 to each of the team members.
    - If you have 3 team members, just assign numbers 1 -3.

- Follow the [application exercise instructions](https://www2.stat.duke.edu/courses/Fall19/sta210.001/labs/lab-03-merge-conflicts.html) **<i>exactly</i>**.

- Raise your hand if you have any questions during the exercise. 

- Completing the exercise will be part of the Lab 03 grade.

- Once you've completed the merge conflict exercise, read the rest of the slides and start working on Lab 03. Use the repo with the prefix **lab-03-slr-inf-** to complete the lab.

---

### Tips for collaborating via GitHub

- Always pull first before you start working.

- Knit, commit, and push often to minimize merge conflicts and/or to make merge conflicts easier to resolve.

- If you find yourself in a situation that is difficult to resolve, ask questions asap, don't let it linger and get bigger.

## Lab Introduction

- In today's lab, you will be analyzing data from the food menu at Starbucks. 

- The focus of the lab is to give you practice conducting statistical inference for simple linear regression. 

- You will also get a chance to explore new data visualizations and functions to summarize data.

---

## Starting a new project

- Go to the course GitHub organization and find the **lab-03-slr-inf** repo that has your team name on it.

- On GitHub, click on the green Clone or download button, select Use HTTPS (this might already be selected by default, and if it is, youâ€™ll see the text Clone with HTTPS). Click on the clipboard icon to copy the repo URL.

- Go to RStudio Cloud and into the course workspace. Create a New Project from Git Repo. You will need to click on the down arrow next to the New Project button to see this option.

- Copy and paste the URL of your assignment repo into the dialog box and click OK. 

---

## Configure Git

- Type the following lines of code in the console in RStudio filling in your name and email address.

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(usethis)
use_git_config(user.name="GITHUB USERNAME", user.email="your email")
```

- Update the name of your RStudio project to "Lab 03"

---

## Tips for Lab

- Each group member should commit and push to GitHub at least once

- It is good practice to name your R code chunks. Do not put spaces in the code chunk names.

- Check the .md file on GitHub to make sure it has all of your work, including output and graphs.
