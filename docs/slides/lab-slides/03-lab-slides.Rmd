## Team Name

.middle[
If you haven't already, please give me your team name by the end of today's lab.

## Tips for collaborating via GitHub

- Always pull first before you start working.

- Knit, commit, and push often to minimize merge conflicts and/or to make merge conflicts easier to resolve.

- If you find yourself in a situation that is difficult to resolve, ask questions asap, don't let it linger and get bigger.

## Lab introduction 

- <font class="vocab">Goal: </font> Use ANOVA to compare group means 

- <font class="vocab">Data:</font> `diamonds` data set in the ggplot2 package  


- Learn about attributes of diamonds: 
    - [https://www.gia.edu/diamond-quality-factor](https://www.gia.edu/diamond-quality-factor)

- Today's lab will focus on color and carat weight
---

## Starting a new project

- Go to the course GitHub organization and find the **lab-03** repo that has your team name on it.

- On GitHub, click on the green Clone or download button, select Use HTTPS (this might already be selected by default, and if it is, youâ€™ll see the text Clone with HTTPS). Click on the clipboard icon to copy the repo URL.

- Go to RStudio Cloud and into the course workspace. Create a New Project from Git Repo. You will need to click on the down arrow next to the New Project button to see this option.

- Copy and paste the URL of your assignment repo into the dialog box and click OK. 

---

## Configure Git

- Type the following lines of code in the console in RStudio filling in your name and email address.

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(usethis)
use_git_config(user.name="your name", user.email="your email")
```

- Update the name of your RStudio project to "Lab 03 - ANOVA"
