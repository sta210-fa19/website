## Starting a new project

- Go to the course GitHub organization and find the **lab-04** repo that has your team name on it.

- On GitHub, click on the green Clone or download button, select Use HTTPS (this might already be selected by default, and if it is, youâ€™ll see the text Clone with HTTPS). Click on the clipboard icon to copy the repo URL.

- Go to RStudio Cloud and into the course workspace. Create a New Project from Git Repo. You will need to click on the down arrow next to the New Project button to see this option.

- Copy and paste the URL of your assignment repo into the dialog box and click OK. 

- **Update the name of your RStudio project to "Lab 04 - Multiple linear regression"**


---

## Configure Git

- Type the following lines of code in the console in RStudio filling in your name and email address.

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(usethis)
use_git_config(user.name="your name", user.email="your email")
```

## Caching your password

You need to cache your password on a per-project basis: 

- Go to the **Terminal** within a project (the most recent lab?)
- Type the following to cache your password for $60 * 60 * 24 * 7 = 604800$ seconds

```{bash eval=FALSE}
git config --global credential.helper 'cache --timeout 604800'
```

You will need to enter your GitHub username and password one more time after caching the password. After that you won't need to enter your credentials for 604800 seconds = 7 days.
