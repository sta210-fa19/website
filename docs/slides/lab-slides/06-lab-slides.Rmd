## Agenda

1. Lab introduction

2. Getting started

## Lab introduction 

- <font class="vocab">Goal: </font> Better understand forward and backward selection and how to conduct these model selection procedures in R
    - This lab will focus on model selection in the `regsubsets` function using Adj. $R^2$ and BIC as selection criteria
    - There are many other selection functions and criteria besides those included in this lab

- <font class="vocab">Data: </font> 
    - Part I: Average SAT scores and associated state characteristics
    - Part II: Performance characteristics and salaries of Major League Baseball players

- <font class="vocab">Tips: </font>
    - Use the [Model Selection notes](https://www2.stat.duke.edu/courses/Spring19/sta210.001/slides/lec-slides/12-model-selection.html#1) to help you complete the lab

## Getting started with the lab

- Go to the course GitHub organization and find the **lab-06** repo that has your team name on it.

- On GitHub, click on the green Clone or download button, select Use HTTPS (this might already be selected by default, and if it is, youâ€™ll see the text Clone with HTTPS). Click on the clipboard icon to copy the repo URL.

- Go to RStudio Cloud and into the course workspace. Create a New Project from Git Repo. You will need to click on the down arrow next to the New Project button to see this option.

- Copy and paste the URL of your assignment repo into the dialog box and click OK. 

- Run the following in the console to configure Git:

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(usethis)
use_git_config(user.name="your name", user.email="your email")
```

- **Use the email address associated with your GitHub account**

## Caching your password

You need to cache your password on a per-project basis: 

- Go to the **Terminal** within a project (the most recent lab?)
- Type the following to cache your password for $60 * 60 * 24 * 7 = 604800$ seconds

```{bash eval=FALSE}
git config --global credential.helper 'cache --timeout 604800'
```

You will need to enter your GitHub username and password one more time after caching the password. After that you won't need to enter your credentials for 604800 seconds = 7 days.
