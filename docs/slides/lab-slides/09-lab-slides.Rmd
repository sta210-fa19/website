### Lab 09: Putting it All Together

- <font class="vocab">Goals</font>:
    - Conduct a full statistical analysis and write results as a short report
    - Practice imputing missing values
    - Use k-fold cross validation to assess model performance
    
- <font class="vocab">Data</font>: `gapminder` dataset in the **dslabs** package

- Use the lecture notes on [missing data](https://www2.stat.duke.edu/courses/Spring19/sta210.001/slides/lec-slides/20-missing-data.html#1) and [k-fold cross validation](https://www2.stat.duke.edu/courses/Spring19/sta210.001/slides/lec-slides/19-validation.html#1) for help with concepts and code.

## Goals for this lab

- Part of the final project will be writing a report (up to 3 pages) about your analysis

- Though there are 3 - 4 people in each group, the final report should read as if it was written by a single author

- This lab will give your group practice putting together a short report before working on the final project. Use this lab to...
    - figure out a work flow that you can use when you work on the final project
    - figure out each group member's strengths and use this to help divide up work for the final project

## Getting started with the lab

- Go to the course GitHub organization and find the **lab-09** repo that has your team name on it.

- On GitHub, click on the green Clone or download button, select Use HTTPS (this might already be selected by default, and if it is, youâ€™ll see the text Clone with HTTPS). Click on the clipboard icon to copy the repo URL.

- Go to RStudio Cloud and into the course workspace. Create a New Project from Git Repo. You will need to click on the down arrow next to the New Project button to see this option.

- Copy and paste the URL of your assignment repo into the dialog box and click OK. 

- Run the following in the console to configure Git:

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(usethis)
use_git_config(user.name="your name", user.email="your email")
```

- **Use the email address associated with your GitHub account**

---

## Caching your password

You need to cache your password on a per-project basis: 

- Go to the **Terminal** within a project (the most recent lab?)
- Type the following to cache your password for $60 * 60 * 24 * 7 = 604800$ seconds

```{bash eval=FALSE}
git config --global credential.helper 'cache --timeout 604800'
```

You will need to enter your GitHub username and password one more time after caching the password. After that you won't need to enter your credentials for 604800 seconds = 7 days.
