### Agenda

1. Lab introduction

2. Working with large data

3. Code for multinomial logistic regression

4. Getting started

---

### Lab 09: Multinomial Logistic Regression 

- <font class="vocab">Goal</font>: Create a multinomial logistic regression model to understand the relationship between a person's political views and their attitude towards government spending on mass transportation

- <font class="vocab">Data</font>: General Social Survey, a survey conducted since 1972 that tracks trends in attitudes towards various societal issues along with behavioral trends. You will use results from the 2016 survey. 

- Use the lecture notes on Multinomial Logistic Regression for help with concepts and code.

---

### Working with large data 

- GitHub will warn you when pushing files larger than 50 MB, and you will not be allowed to push files larger than 100 MB.

- The size of the data file we're working with it 34.3 MB.  Compare that to the Spotify dataset from last weeks' lab which was 149 KB (0.149 MB)!

- While our file is smaller than these limits, it's still large enough to not push to GitHub.

---

### Working with large data 

- `gitignore`: Contains a list of the files you don't want to to commit to Git or push to GitHub.
    -  If you open the `.gitignore` file in your project, you'll see that our data file, `gss2016.csv`, is already listed there.
    - You won't be pushing the data to GitHub, but since each team member will have the data in their projects, you can still all work with it.
    - **Don't touch the data file though!** Git isn't tracking it, so you nobody will be able to tell if you modify it. Just read it in, and work with it in R.

### Code for multinomial logistic regression 

(using the NHANES data from [Wednesday's lecture](https://www2.stat.duke.edu/courses/Fall19/sta210.001/slides/lec-slides/20-multinomial-logistic-pt2.html#1))

---

### Fit Model

- Use the <font class="vocab">`multinom()`</font> function in the `nnet` package 

```{r eval=F}
library(nnet)
my.model <- multinom(Y ~ X1 + X2 + ... + XP, data=my.data)
```

```{r eval = F}
tidy(my.model, exponentiate = FALSE) #display log-odds model
```

---

### NHANES: Fit Model


```{r echo = F}
library(NHANES)

nhanes_adult <- NHANES %>%
  filter(Age >= 18) %>%
  select(HealthGen, Age, PhysActive, Education) %>%
  drop_na() %>%
  mutate(obs_num = 1:n())
```

```{r results = "hide"}
library(nnet)
health_m <- multinom(HealthGen ~ Age + PhysActive, 
                     data = nhanes_adult)
```

---

### Display model

.small[
```{r}
tidy(health_m, exponentiate = FALSE, conf.int = TRUE) %>%
  kable(digits = 3, format = "markdown")
```
]

---

### Calculate predicted probabilities

```{r}
pred_probs <- as_tibble(predict(health_m, type = "probs")) %>% #<<
                        mutate(obs_num = 1:n())
```

```{r}
pred_probs %>%
  slice(1:5)
```

---

### Calculate predicted probabilities

```{r}
pred_probs <- as_tibble(predict(health_m, type = "probs")) %>% 
                        mutate(obs_num = 1:n()) #<<
```

```{r}
pred_probs %>%
  slice(1:5)
```

---

### Calculate residuals 

```{r}
#calculate residuals
residuals <- as_tibble(residuals(health_m)) %>%  #<<
  setNames(paste('resid.', names(.), sep = "")) %>% 
  mutate(obs_num = 1:n()) 
```

```{r}
residuals %>%
  slice(1:5)
```

---

### Calculate residuals 

```{r}
#calculate residuals
residuals <- as_tibble(residuals(health_m)) %>% 
  setNames(paste('resid.', names(.), sep = "")) %>% #<<
  mutate(obs_num = 1:n()) 
```

```{r}
residuals %>%
  slice(1:5)
```
---

### Calculate residuals 

```{r}
#calculate residuals
residuals <- as_tibble(residuals(health_m)) %>% 
  setNames(paste('resid.', names(.), sep = "")) %>% 
  mutate(obs_num = 1:n()) #<<
```

```{r}
residuals %>%
  slice(1:5)
```

---

### Put everything in one dataset

```{r message = F, warning = F}
health_m_aug <- inner_join(nhanes_adult, pred_probs) #<<
health_m_aug <- inner_join(health_m_aug, residuals) 
```

```{r}
health_m_aug %>% 
  glimpse()
```

---

### Put everything in one dataset

```{r message = F, warning = F}
health_m_aug <- inner_join(nhanes_adult, pred_probs) 
health_m_aug <- inner_join(health_m_aug, residuals) #<<
```

```{r}
health_m_aug %>% 
  glimpse()
```

---

### Getting started with the lab

- Go to the course GitHub organization and find the **lab-09** repo that has your team name on it.

- On GitHub, click on the green Clone or download button, select Use HTTPS (this might already be selected by default, and if it is, youâ€™ll see the text Clone with HTTPS). Click on the clipboard icon to copy the repo URL.

- Go to RStudio Cloud and into the course workspace. Create a New Project from Git Repo. You will need to click on the down arrow next to the New Project button to see this option.

- Copy and paste the URL of your assignment repo into the dialog box and click OK. 

- Run the following in the console to configure Git:

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(usethis)
use_git_config(user.name="github username", user.email="your email")
```

---

### Caching your password

You need to cache your password on a per-project basis: 

- Go to the **Terminal** within a project (the most recent lab?)
- Type the following to cache your password for $60 * 60 * 24 * 7 = 604800$ seconds

```{bash eval=FALSE}
git config --global credential.helper 'cache --timeout 604800'
```

You will need to enter your GitHub username and password one more time after caching the password. After that you won't need to enter your credentials for 604800 seconds = 7 days.
