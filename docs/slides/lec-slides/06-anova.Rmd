### Packages and Data

```{r packages}
library(tidyverse)
library(broom)
library(knitr)
```

---

### Population densities in the Midwest

- Data is in the `midwest` dataset in the ggplot2 package

- The data contains demographic information for all counties in each of the states in the Midwest: 
Illinois (IL), Indiana (IN), Michigan (MI), Ohio (OH), and Wisconsin (WI)
    - We will focus on the population density, **`popdensity`**

```{r}
glimpse(midwest)
```

---

### Exploratory Data Analysis 

```{r echo = F}
ggplot(data = midwest, aes(x = state, y = popdensity)) +
  geom_boxplot() + 
  labs(title = "Population Density by State", 
       subtitle = "in the Midwest", 
       x = "State", 
       y = "Population Density")
```

---

The distributions are very skewed by outliers, so let's look at the log of population density (more on log transformations in a few weeks)

```{r}
midwest <- midwest %>% mutate(log_popdensity = log(popdensity))
```

```{r echo = F}
ggplot(data = midwest, aes(x = state, y = log_popdensity)) +
  geom_boxplot() + 
  labs(title = "Log(Population Density) by State", 
       subtitle = "in the Midwest", 
       x = "State", 
       y = "Logged Population Density")
```

---

```{r}
ggplot(data = midwest, aes(x = log_popdensity, fill = state)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) + 
  labs(title = "log(Population Density) by State", 
       subtitle = "in the Midwest", 
       x = "log(Population Density)", 
       color = "State")
```

---

### Exploratory Data Analysis

```{r}
midwest %>%
  group_by(state) %>%
  summarise(mean = mean(log_popdensity), var = var(log_popdensity))
```

### Using ANOVA to compare group means

---

class: middle

So far, we have used a <u>*quantitative*</u> predictor variable to understand the variation in a quantitative response variable.
<br>


Now, we will use a <u>*categorical (qualitative)*</u> predictor variable to understand the variation in a quantitative response variable.

---

### Notation

- $K$ is number of mutually exclusive groups. We index the groups as $i = 1,\dots, K$.
<br>

--

- $n_i$ is number of observations in group $i$
<br>

--

- $n = n_1 + n_2 + \dots + n_K$ is the total number of observations in the data
<br>

--
  
- $y_{ij}$ is the $j^{th}$ observation in group $i$, for all $i,j$
<br>

--

- $\mu_i$ is the population mean for group $i$, for $i = 1,\dots, K$

---

### Motivating ANOVA

- <font class = "vocab">Question: </font> Is there a significant relationship between the predictor variable $x$ and the response variable $y$?

- In other words, is the mean value of the response equal for all groups? 


--
.alert[ 
**Model structure:**

$$y_{ij} = \mu + \alpha_i + \epsilon_{ij}$$
- $\mu$ is the overall mean, 
- $\alpha_i$ is how much the mean for group $i$ deviates from $\mu$
- $\epsilon_{ij}$ is the amount $y_{ij}$ deviates from the group mean
]

--

- Note that the mean response for group $i$ is $\mu_i = \mu + \alpha_i$. 

---

### Motivating ANOVA

.alert[
$$y_{ij} = \mu + \alpha_i + \epsilon_{ij}$$
]

- <font class="vocab">Assumption: </font> $\epsilon_{ij}$ follows a Normal distribution with mean 0 and constant variance $\sigma^2$
$$\epsilon_{ij} \sim N(0,\sigma^2)$$

- This is the same as $$y_{ij} \sim N(\mu_i, \sigma^2)$$
  
---

### Hypotheses

- <font class="vocab">Question of interest </font> Is there a significant difference in the means across the $K$ groups?

- To answer this question, we will test the following hypotheses:

.alert[
$$
\begin{aligned}
&H_0: \mu_1 = \mu_2 = \dots =  \mu_K\\
&H_a: \text{At least one }\mu_i \text{ is not equal to the others}
\end{aligned}
$$
]

--

- <font class = "vocab">How to think about it:</font>  If the sample means are "far apart", " there is evidence against $H_0$

- We will calculate a test statistic to quantify "far apart" in the context of the data
 
---

### Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)

- **Main Idea: ** Decompose the <font color="green">total variation</font> in the data into the variation <font color="blue">between groups</font> and the variation <font color="red">within each group</font>

$$\color{green}{\sum_{i=1}^{K}\sum_{j=1}^{n_i}(y_{ij}- \bar{y})^2}=\color{blue}{\sum_{i=1}^{K}n_i(\bar{y}_i-\bar{y})^2} + \color{red}{\sum_{i=1}^{K}\sum_{j=1}^{n_i}(y_{ij}-\bar{y}_i)^2}$$
<br>

--

- If the variation <font color="blue">between groups</font> is significantly greater than the variation <font color="red">within each group</font>, then there is evidence against the null hypothesis.

### ANOVA table for comparing means

.small[
|  | Sum of Squares | DF | Mean Square | F-Stat| p-value |
|------------------|----------------|--------------------|-------------|-------------|--------------------|
| Between (Model) | $\sum\limits_{i=1}^{K}n_i(\bar{y}_i-\bar{y})^2$ | $K-1$ | $SSB/(K-1)$ | $MSB/MSW$ | $P(F > \text{F-Stat})$ |
| Within (Residual) | $\sum\limits_{i=1}^{K}\sum\limits_{j=1}^{n_i}(y_{ij}-\bar{y}_i)^2$ | $n-K$ | $SSW/(n-K)$ |  |  |
| Total | $\sum\limits_{i=1}^{K}\sum\limits_{j=1}^{n_i}(y_{ij}-\bar{y})^2$ | $n-1$ | $SST/(n-1)$ |  |  |
]

---

### F-Distribution 

The ANOVA test statistic follows an $F$ distribution

```{r, echo=F}
x <- seq(from =0, to = 5, length = 100)

# Evaluate the densities
y_1 <- df(x, 1,2)
y_2 <- df(x,2,2)
y_3 <- df(x,10,2)
y_4 <- df(x,10,10)

# Plot the densities
plot(x, y_1, col = 1, type = "l", ylab="",lwd=3)
lines(x,y_2, col = 2,lwd=3)
lines(x, y_3, col = 3,lwd=3)
lines(x, y_4, col = 4,lwd=3)

# Add the legend
legend("topright", title = "F Distribution",
       c("df = (1,2)", "df = (2,2)", "df = (10,2)", "df = (10,10)"), 
       col = c(1, 2, 3, 4), lty = 1)
```

---

### Total Variation

- Total variation = variation between and within groups 

$$SST =\sum_{i=1}^{K}\sum_{j=1}^{n_i}(y_{ij}-\bar{y})^2$$
--

- Degrees of freedom
$$DFT = n-1$$
--

- Estimate of the variance across all observations: 
$$\frac{SST}{DFT} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{K}\sum_{j=1}^{n_i}(y_{ij}-\bar{y})^2}{n-1} = s_y^2$$

---

### Between Variation (Model)

- Variation in the group means

$$SSB = \sum_{i=1}^{K}n_i(\bar{y}_i-\bar{y})^2$$
--

- **Degrees of freedom**
$$DFB = K-1$$
--

- **Mean Squares Between**
$$MSB = \frac{SSB}{DFB} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{K}n_i(\bar{y}_i-\bar{y})^2}{K-1}$$
--

- MSB is an estimate of the variance of the $\mu_i$'s 
  
  
---

### Within Variation (Residual)

- Variation within each group

$$SSW=\sum_{i=1}^{K}\sum_{j=1}^{n_i}(y_{ij}-\bar{y}_k)^2$$
--

- **Degrees of freedom**

$$DFW = n-K$$
--

- **Mean Squares Within**
$$MSW = \frac{SSW}{DFW} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{K}\sum_{j=1}^{n_i}(y_{ij}-\bar{y}_i)^2}{n-K}$$
--

- MSW is the estimate of $\sigma^2$, the variance within each group

---

### Population densities in the Midwest

```{r}
pop_anova <- aov(log(popdensity) ~ state, data = midwest)
tidy(pop_anova) %>% kable(format = "markdown", digits = 3)
```

.question[
- How many observations (counties) are in the data? 

- What is $\hat{\sigma}^2$, the estimated variance within each group? 

- State the null and alternative hypothesis for this test. What is your conclusion?
]


---

### Assumptions for ANOVA

- <font class="vocab">Normality: </font> $y_{ij} \sim N(\mu_i, \sigma^2)$

- <font class="vocab">Equal (Constant) Variance: </font> The population distribution for each group has a common variance, $\sigma^2$

- <font class="vocab">Independence: </font> The observations are independent from one another
    - This applies to observation within and between groups

- We can typically check these assumptions in the exploratory data analysis

---

### Robustness to Assumptions

- <font class="vocab">Normality: </font> $y_{ij} \sim N(\mu_i, \sigma^2)$
  + ANOVA relatively robust to departures from Normality. 
  + Concern when there are strongly skewed distributions with different sample sizes (especially if sample sizes are small, < 10 in each group)
  

- <font class="vocab">Independence: </font> There is independence within and across groups
  + If this doesn't hold, should use methods that account for correlated errors

---

### Robustness to Assumptions


- <font class="vocab">Equal (Constant) Variance: </font> The population distribution for each group has a common variance, $\sigma^2$
  + Critical assumption, since the pooled (combined) variance is important for ANOVA
  + General rule: If the sample sizes within each group are approximately equal, the results of the F-test are valid if the largest variance is no more than 4 times the small variance (i.e. the largest standard deviation is no more than 2 times the smallest standard deviation)

## Multiple Comparisons

---

### After ANOVA: Individual Group Means

- Suppose you conduct an ANOVA and conclude that at least one group mean has a different mean response value. 

- The next question you want to answer is **which group?**

--

- One way to answer this question is to compare the estimated means for each group, accounting for the random variability we'd naturally expect

- Since we've assumed the variance is the same for all groups, we can use a pooled standard error with $n-K$ degrees of freedom to calculate the confidence

.alert[
$$\bar{y}_i \pm t^* \times \frac{s_P}{\sqrt{n_i}}$$
where $s_P$ is the pooled standard error
]

---

 
### After ANOVA: Difference in Means

- We can also estimate the difference in two means, $\mu_1-\mu_2$ for each pair of groups

.alert[
$$(\bar{y}_1-\bar{y}_2) \pm t^* \times s_P\sqrt{\frac{1}{n_1}+\frac{1}{n_2}}$$
where $s_P$ is the pooled standard error
]

- If we have $K$ groups, we will make ${K \choose 2} = K(K-1)/2$ such comparisons
    - Ex: If we have 6 groups, we'll make ${6 \choose 2} = 6(6-1)/2 = 15$ comparisons

---

 

### Multiple Comparisons

- When making multiple comparisons, there is a higher chance that a Type I error will occur, e.g. conclude that there is a significant difference between two groups even when there is not


- **At a Minimum**: When calculating multiple confidence intervals or conducting multiple hypothesis tests to compare means, you should clearly state how many CIs and/or tests you computed.


- **Good practice**: Account for the number of comparisons being made in the analysis 
    - We will discuss one method: <font class = "vocab">Bonferroni correction</font>

---

### Confidence levels

- <font class="vocab">Individual confidence level: </font> success rate of a procedure for calculating a <u>single</u> confidence interval


--
- <font class="vocab">Familywise confidence level: </font> success rate of a procedure for calculating a <u>family</u> of confidence intervals 
  + "success": all intervals in the family capture their parameters


--
- <font class="vocab">Issue: </font>There is an increased chance of making at least one error when calculating multiple confidence intervals
  + The same is true when conducting multiple hypothesis tests


---

### Bonferroni correction

- <font class="vocab">Goal: </font> Achieve at least $100(1-\alpha)$% familywise confidence level for $\mathcal{C}$ confidence intervals 
    - Where $\alpha$ is the significance level for the corresponding two-sided hypothesis test

--

- Calculate each of the $k$ confidence intervals at a $100(1-\frac{\alpha}{\mathcal{C}})$% confidence level
    - When there are $K$ groups, there are $\mathcal{C}=\frac{K(K-1)}{2}$ pairs of means that can be compared 
--

- **Notes**: 
    + The exact familywise confidence level is not easily predictable. This partially depends on the level of dependence between the intervals. 
    + Bonferroni correction is sometimes too conservative, i.e don't reject $H_0$ as much as you should

---

### Population Density in the Midwest

- There are 5 groups (states) in the `midwest` data, so we will do ${5 \choose 2} = 10$ comparisons. 

- If we want a familywise confidence level of 95%, then we should use a $(1 - 0.05/10)\times 100 = 99.5$% confidence level for each pairwise comparison

---

### Pairwise CI

.small[
```{r}
library(pairwiseCI)
pairwiseCI(log_popdensity ~ state, data = midwest, method = "Param.diff", conf.level = 0.995, var.equal = TRUE) %>% 
  kable(format = "markdown")
```
