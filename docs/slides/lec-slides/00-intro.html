## What is Regression Analysis?

"In statistical modeling, regression analysis is a set of statistical processes for estimating the relationships among variables. It includes many techniques for modeling and analyzing several variables, when &lt;font class="vocab"&gt;**the focus is on the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables (or 'predictors')**&lt;/font&gt;. More specifically, regression analysis helps one understand how the typical value of the dependent variable (or 'criterion variable') changes when any one of the independent variables is varied, while the other independent variables are held fixed."

### Apartments in New York City

*"We ran a &lt;font class = "vocab"&gt;regression&lt;/font&gt; to find the relationship between the rent of a one-bedroom home and the average of travel time from the station nearest to it to Midtown or downtown. It showed rent increasing by $56 per minute of decrease in average travel time."*

### Impact on Educational Achievement

*"Our objectives were to ... determine whether there are differences in the impact of lead across the  EOG [End of Grade] distribution, and elucidate the impact of cumulative childhood social and environmental stress on educational outcomes. &lt;font class = "vocab"&gt;Multivariate and quantile regression techniques were employed.&lt;/font&gt;...The effects of environmental and social stressors (especially as they stretch out the lower tail of the EOG distribution) demonstrate the particular vulnerabilities of socioeconomically and environmentally disadvantaged children."*

### Analyzing Primary Polls

*"We can also take these polling averages and estimate the probability of a candidate winning a party’s nomination using a &lt;font class="vocab"&gt;logistic regression&lt;/font&gt;."*
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

*"In fact, we can use a &lt;font class = "vocab"&gt;logistic regression&lt;/font&gt; to estimate a high- and low-name-recognition candidate’s chance of winning the nomination based on their polling average..."*

### FiveThirtyEight March Madness Predictions

*"[Live win probabilities] probabilities are derived using &lt;font class="vocab"&gt;logistic regression analysis&lt;/font&gt;, which lets us plug the current state of a game into a model to produce the probability that either team will win the game.*"

## Movie Data Analysis

1. In the *Files* pane in the bottom right corner, spot the file called `movies.Rmd`. Open it, and then click on the "Knit" button.

2. Put your name in the author field at the top of the file (in the  `yaml` -- we will discuss what this is at a later date). Knit again.

3. Change the genre names in parts 1 and 2 to genres that interest you. The spelling and capitalization must match what's in the data, so you can use the Appendix to see the correct spelling and capitalization. Knit again.

You have made your first data visualization this semester!
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

## Discussion

Discuss the following with a partner.

1. Start by introducing yourself! Name, year, major/ academic interest, favorite hobby.

2. Consider the plot in Part 1. 
    - Describe how movie revenue has changed over time. 
    - Suppose we use revenue as a measure of popularity. How has the popularity of each genre changed over time? In other words, are the genres that were most popular in 1986 still the most popular today?

3. Consider the plot in Part 2. 
   - Which genre(s) tend to have the highest budgets?
    - In general, what is the relationship between a movie's budget and its total revenue? Are there any genres that show a different relationship between budget and revenue?

## Academic Honesty

All work for this class should be done in accordance with the Duke Community Standard. 

&gt; To uphold the Duke Community Standard:
&gt; - I will not lie, cheat, or steal in my academic endeavors;
&gt; - I will conduct myself honorably in all my endeavors; and
&gt; - I will act if the Standard is compromised.

Any violations will automatically result in a grade of 0 on the assignment and will be reported to [Office of Student Conduct](https://studentaffairs.duke.edu/conduct) for further action.

---

## Reusing Code

- Unless explicitly stated otherwise, you may make use of online resources (e.g. StackOverflow) for coding examples on assignments. If you directly use code from an outside source (or use it as inspiration), you must or explicitly cite where you obtained the code. Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism.

- On individual assignments, you may discuss the assignment with one another; however, you may not directly share code or write up with other students. 

- On team assignments, you may not directly share code or write up with another team. Unauthorized sharing of the code or write up will be considered a violation for all students involved. 

---

## Where to find help

- **If you have a question during lecture or lab, feel free to ask it!** There are likely other students with the same question, so by asking you will create a learning opportunity for everyone. 

--

- **Office Hours**: A lot of questions are most effectively answered in-person, so office hours are a valuable resource. Please use them!

--

- **Piazza**: Outside of class and office hours, any general questions about course content or assignments should be posted on Piazza since there are likely other students with the same questions. 

---

## Academic Resource Center

Sometimes you may need help with the class that is beyond what can be provided by the teaching team. In that instance, I encourage you to visit the Academic Resource Center.  
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

.small[
The [Academic Resource Center (ARC)](https://arc.duke.edu) offers free services to all students during their undergraduate careers at Duke.  Services include Learning Consultations, Peer Tutoring and Study Groups, ADHD/LD Coaching, Outreach Workshops, and more. Because learning is a process unique to every individual, they work with each student to discover and develop their own academic strategy for success at Duke. Contact the ARC to schedule an appointment. Undergraduates in any year, studying any discipline can benefit! Contact &lt;a href="mailto:arc@duke.edu" title="email"&gt;ARC@duke.edu&lt;/a&gt;, 919-684-5917, 211 Academic Advising Center Building, East Campus – behind Marketplace.
]
---

## Technology 

- You should bring a laptop to every lecture and lab session.  Outlets are limited, so make sure it is fully-charged.

- Ensure the volume on all devices is set to mute.

- Refrain from engaging in activities not related to the class discussion. Browsing the web and social media, excessive messaging, playing games, etc. is not only a distraction for you but is also a distraction for everyone around you.

---

## Accessibility 

Please contact the [Student Disability Access Office (SDAO)](https://access.duke.edu) if there is an element of the course that is not accessible to you. There you can engage in a confidential conversation about the process for requesting reasonable accommodations. 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Please note that accommodations are not provided retroactively, so please contact them as soon as possible.  More information can be found online at [access.duke.edu](https://access.duke.edu). 

---

### Inclusion 

In this course, we will strive to create a learning environment that is welcoming to all students and that is in alignment with [Duke’s Commitment to Diversity and Inclusion](https://provost.duke.edu/initiatives/commitment-to-diversity-and-inclusion). If there is any aspect of the class that is not welcoming or accessible to you, please let me know immediately. 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; 

Additionally, if you are experiencing something outside of class that is affecting your performance in the course, please feel free to talk with me and/or your academic dean.
